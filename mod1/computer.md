__Introduction to Computers__


What is a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)?
---
- a machine consists of hardware, data and software 
- can be programmed to carry out tasks automatically
- connects and communicates to other computers through network
- with specific peripherals for specific usage


How fast are computers developing?
---
- [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) is the observation that 
  - the number of transistors in an microchip doubles about every two years


How is a computer organized from [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware)?
---
- computer components can be categorized into several logic units or sections

| Logic units or sections | Function | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input units | Acquire and receive information |  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è keyboard, touch screen, mice, touchpads<br/> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è microphone, camera, scanner<br/> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è GPS, compass, thermometer, gyroscope, accelerometer |
| Output units | present or output processed information | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è screen, printer <br/> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è speaker, beeper <br/> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è activators such as the steering wheel of autonomous vehicles  |
| Memory units | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è hold data for processing <br/>‚ñ∂Ô∏è hold software for running | DDR RAM |
| Secondary Storage Units | save data and software persistently | SSD, USB drive, DVD |
| Central processing units (CPU) |  coordinates and supervises the operation of the other units | multicore processors |
| Arithmetic and logic units (ALU) | perform arithmetic and logic operations | part of CPU |

- many devices can be used for both input and output such as network communication devices
